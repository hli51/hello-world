Hello, world!

My name is Jeff. Welcome to my GitHub account. I am learning programming with the goal of becoming a software developer. Please reach out if you want to help me in this journey or if you wish to connect.

Outside of my professional life, I enjoy reading books (right now I'm reading Jorge Luis Borges' collection <i>The Aleph</i>), visiting museums (most recent is the Metropolitan Museum of Art where I saw, among other things, Leonardo's <i>St. Jerome</i>), going to music concerts, and exploring New York City (I like the West Village, the East Village, the Flatiron District, the area around Union Square Park, the Upper West Side, occasionally certain parts of Brooklyn, and Midtown because its regular grid structure is so navigable).
